# Edison Clock

This repository contains a small Python script that prints the current time
using an Edison bulb style font. The program relies on the `pyfiglet` library
and uses the `bulbhead` font to mimic a vintage bulb display.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `pyfiglet` Python package

Install `pyfiglet` with pip if necessary:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python3 edison_clock.py
```

The output will show the current time in large, bulb-styled letters.
