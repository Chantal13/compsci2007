# Edison Clock

This repository contains a small Python script that prints the current time in
a colorful Edison bulb style. The display updates every second and shows a
rainbow cascade across the digits.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `pyfiglet` and `colorama` Python packages

Install the required packages with pip if necessary:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet colorama
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python3 edison_clock.py
```

The output will show the current time in a rainbow-colored bulbhead font. The
display refreshes in place every second. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.
